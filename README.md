# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository contains projects I have created throughout my post-secondary experience in Machine Learning Analyst.
Traffic Volume Analysis & Forecasting:

Built regression models to analyze and predict annual motor vehicle traffic using road characteristics, time-based features, and local authority data. Applied extensive feature engineering, regularization, and model comparison to balance accuracy and generalization. Results were communicated through interactive visualizations to highlight long-term trends and regional differences.

National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) Forecasting:

Analyzed historical pollutant release data across Canadian provinces to identify long-term environmental trends and forecast future emissions. Aggregated facility-level records, handled reporting inconsistencies, and applied regression models to support environmental monitoring and policy-oriented insights.

Dealer-Level Service Revenue Analysis (GoAuto Project – Open Data Replica):

Modeled service revenue patterns using vehicle and service-related features to identify key drivers of dealership performance. Trained and evaluated regression models to forecast revenue trends and demonstrated how insights could support operational planning and decision-making.

Customer Behavior / Churn Analysis (WIL Open Data Replica)

Used open customer datasets to replicate an industry churn analysis workflow. Performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and classification modeling to identify factors associated with customer retention and attrition.
